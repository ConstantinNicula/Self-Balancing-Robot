# Self-Balancing-Robot
Self-balancing robot based on an ARM STMF103 microcontroller and MPU6050 6DOF IMU
## Software and theory 
- Stability achieved using a cascade PID controller
- Pitch approximation based on complementarity filter
-Software was developed in C in Keil uVision5. 
## Hardware 
-	Most of the robot parts were designed in Fusion360 and 3d printed (Files are available in /CAD_Files) 
-	STM32 Nucleo-64 development board (Main board)
-	JGB37-520 Brushed DC Motors with integrated Hall encoders (12V 320RPM)
-	MPU6050 IMU
-	Motor drivers based on VNH2SP30 IC 
-	KRYPTONIUM 3s 1800mAh LiPo battery
